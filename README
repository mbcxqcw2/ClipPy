PREAMBLE

This script performs time-domain RFI clipping on 8-bit or 32-bit filterbank files.

All code was developed for e-MERLIN's LOFT-e observing system.

Code was developed by Charles Walker (walker.mbcxqcw2@gmail.com). Please cite accordingly. 

(Note to Charlie: Add to ASCL!)

The RFI clipping algorithm is described in detail in: Charles Walker's thesis: https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/localising-fast-transients(d2847c6c-1b0f-43d9-9155-f8dccb432cb9).html

PYTHON REQUIREMENTS
os
numpy
matplotlib
astropy
sigpyproc

EXTRA REQUIREMENTS
dspsr (for folding pulsar data)
pav   (for plotting archive files)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Run "python Mary_Clipping_Script.py" from the command line
The file "Cm1670.File1.8bit.fil" will be RFI clipped and output as "Mary_test.fil"
Run dspsr commands noted in "Mary_Clipping_Script.py" to generate plots to compare PSRB0329+54 pulse profile pre- and post- RFI clipping.
